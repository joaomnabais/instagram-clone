# Instagram Clone
This project is a simple Feed UI clone of Instagram App.

## Expo CLI
To run this app you need Expo CLI. To install it just type the following command:
### `npm install -g expo-cli`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, for the first time you need to install "node_modules" typing the next command:
### `npm i`

Once installed before running the application you need to run the back-end server simulator so that the application can make api calls. To do it just type the following command on the root directory:
### `npm json-server server.json -d 1000 -w`

In case you are an Android simulator user(ios users can skip this step), with the back-end server simulator already running and the android simulator too, you need the Android simulator to understand localhost as your machine. To do it just type the following command in other terminal window:
### `adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000`

Completed all the steps above just run the app with the next command:
### `expo start`
